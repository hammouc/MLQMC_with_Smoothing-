\begin{frame}{Motivation}
	\begin{block}{Setting}
		The goal is to approximate the option price $\E[g(X)]$ where $g$ is the payoff function of an option and $X$ is a random variable that depends on a stock or a system of stocks. 
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Problem}
		The plain MC estimator has always a convergence rate of $0.5$ independently of the smoothness and the dimension of the problem. To get higher convergence rates up to $1$, we could use MLMC, QMC, or a combination of both called MLQMC. These methods have the disadvantage that their convergence rate deteriorates when the problem has a low regularity.
